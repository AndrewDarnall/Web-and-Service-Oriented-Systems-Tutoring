# Hyperyext Pre-Processor

`php`, at times known informally as 'personal home page' was originally a `C`-based pre-processor for `.html` files before serving them according to an `HTTP` request.
<br>
This type of `web-programming` is known as `dynamic` web pages.
<br>
The core mecchanism is that of scanning and appropriately `substituting` the values within the markup file based on the php descriptions and then returning the appropriate hypertext.
<br>
<br>
To this day circa 2 **billion** websites run on `php`.

- Fun fact, `Facebook` was originally developed in `php` and to this day some of its components still run on the same language, however `META`, due to the instability of the language, built a successor to the language called `Hak`, which to this day is used in most of the social media.
